        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Humans are bad at making pin codes, like really bad most of us normaly just use a common code like 6969 or personal number like 4114. But this is a terrible practice especially on a game like rust where if someone guesses a code it could mean weeks of lost work. you can easily minimize that rist by using this simple utility.
  
  Rust Pin Generator is very easy to use. Just click on the Generate button than you can either copy the pin by pressing copy, save it by adding a name and pressing save or you can regenerate by pressing generate again.
  
  Saved codes can be accessed, copied and deleted in the saved pins tab.</p>
